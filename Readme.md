This is not a real game, not now any way. This is just a prototype.

For linux users:  

You can compile it yourself with the next simple console command:  
`make && ./run`

But make sure that you have installed:  
* boost library  
* sfml libray  

Note: the code was made and run on Linux Ubuntu 18.04. Windows and MAC is not checked.
