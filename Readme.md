# Shooter #

This is not a real game, not now any way. This is just a prototype.

For linux users:  

You can compile it yourself with the next simple console command:  
`make && ./run`

But make sure that you have installed:  
* BOOST library  
* SFML library  

Notes: 
* The code was made and run on Linux Ubuntu 18.04. Windows and MAC is not checked.  
* Fullscreen does not work correctly with 2 screens in SFML version lower than 2.5.1

Done in the current release:  
* Refactoring & optimization
* A map editor (now *tiledmap* (mapeditor.org) is used for a level creation)  
* Full screen mode (need to press F for that)
* An easy *AI* 

In the future releases:  
* Further optimization
* Improving *AI*
* New Textures
* New Objects for the interaction  
* Real levels
* A game plot
